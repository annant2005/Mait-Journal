      Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology was established in 1999 by
      Maharaja Agrasen Technical Education Society promoted by a group of well
      known Industrialists, Businessman, Professionals and Philanthropists with
      an aim to promote quality education in the field of Technology and
      Management. Since then, MAIT has grown from strength to strength to emerge
      as one of the top technical institutes among the private Institutes and
      has been constantly ranked amongst the top engineering Institutes by
      DATAQUEST. To build lasting relations with Industries, MAIT invites
      industries to join hands in fulfilling the social responsibility of
      imparting industry relevant technical education and training. Its alumni
      have also distinguished themselves through their achievements in and has
      been contributing significantly to industry, academics, research,
      business, government and social domains. The institute continues to work
      closely with the alumni to enhance its activities through interactions in
      academic and research programmes.

                  Welcome to the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Delhi. We started our journey in the year 2019 with the Mechanical stream and have a strong undergraduate program that enables the young minds to formulate, solve and analyze engineering problems & challenges and promote student awareness for life-long learning. The department also emphasizes the students to undertake various research projects and do industrial training within four years of the study as per the curriculum of GGSIPU, Delhi. Students are placed for training in the industry and learn industrial practices with professional ethics and codes. The mission of the department is to offer excellence in Mechanical Engineering Education such that students pursue professional career or higher education for further enhancement of their knowledge.

                  The department has well experienced and dedicated faculty members and staff with diversified specializations. Most of the faculty members are holding Doctorates and engaged in producing numerous research publications in International/National Journals and conferences, highlighting the emphasis on research and development. We are striving hard continuously to improve upon the quality of education and to maintain its position of leadership in Engineering and Technology.

                  Our extensive state-of-the-art infrastructure including well-developed laboratories for courses like Thermal Engineering, Machine Design, Manufacturing Science and Technology, Theory of Machines, RAC, Heat transfer, CAD/CAM etc. provide unprecedented opportunities for students to learn and practice in Mechanical Engineering. The department has strong interaction with all nearby Industries and Institutes and periodically organizes workshops, FDPs, Seminars, Conferences etc. which provides additional enriched learning.
